        <p>Facebook DBMS makes it possible for to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible. At Facebook we use MySQL to manage many petabytes of data, along with the Inno DB storage engine that serves social activities such as likes, comments, and shares.
            Facebook tracks its users across the web by using tracking cookies. If a user is logged into Facebook and simultaneously browses other websites, Facebook can track the sites they are visiting.
